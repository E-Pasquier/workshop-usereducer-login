## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Credential to fake a login :
username: pierre
password: password

### `Create a reducer function from scratch within your component`

Using a switch case statement, construct your reducer function. Within the function you want to predict each action of state you need, by reading the current state with useState.
**Note: reducer method should return an object ( a state )!**

### `Comment useState hooks, and create a useReducer`

useReducer takes two arguments: your reducer function, and an initial state object.

### `Dispatch your action across your component feature`

**Note: !**

We want an action to fill login and password inputs
We want an action to set On and Off a loader
We want an action to start trigger an asynchronous login


## To make this work, how would you dispatch some action from login.js ?
