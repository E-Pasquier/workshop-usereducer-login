## 1 – Create a reducer function from scratch within your component

Using a switch case statement, construct your reducer function. Within the function, you want to predict each action of the state you need, by analyzing the current state-managed with useState.
**Note: reducer method should return an object ( a state )!**

## 2 – Comment lines with useState hooks, and initialize a useReducer hook

useReducer takes two arguments: your reducer function and an initial state object.

## 3 – Dispatch your action where it makes sense in your component

**Note: We want an action to fill login and password inputs, an action to set On and Off a loader, and an action to handle an asynchronous login.**

## To make this work, how would you dispatch some action from login.js?

For a recap on how to create a specific method, check out the [useReducer documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer).# workshop-usereducer-login
